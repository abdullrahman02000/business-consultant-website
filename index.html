                <p>Article 8 of the Law of Companies No 21 (1997) states: “A private sector company is established on the agreement between two or more persons outside the state sector, using private capital.” Article 8 also has a provision that includes private-joint stock or limited liability companies whenever the state holds a share of less than 25% of the capital. Internationally, it is widely accepted that the private sector is the part of the national economy that is not under direct state control and that is run for profit.</p>
